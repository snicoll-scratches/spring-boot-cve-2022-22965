Spring Boot 2.4.x is https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot#support[out of OSS support], the latest version is `2.4.13`. It uses Spring Framework `5.3.13` that is vulnerable to https://spring.io/blog/2022/03/31/spring-framework-rce-early-announcement[Cve-2022-22965].

Three sample projects are provided:

* `spring-boot-2.4-gradle`: A gradle-based project showcasing how you can use `ext` to override the Spring Framework version.
* `spring-boot-2.4-maven`: A maven-based project showcasing how you can use the `spring-framework.version` property when using the Spring Boot parent.
* `spring-boot-2.4-maven-custom-parent`: A maven-based project showcasing how you can import the Spring Framework BOM when using a custom parent.
